Abstract The internet and technological advance-
ments are rapidly growing in this era, potentially
giving rise to new challenges, particularly in data
security. One algorithm developed to secure data is the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The strength
of AES lies in its S-box, which transforms input bits
into output bits in a randomized manner. Therefore,
the S-box must be highly resilient against various
attacks, especially linear and differential attacks. This
paper modiﬁes the AES S-box algorithm. The mod-
iﬁcation begins with the irreducible polynomial in the
AES S-box, x
8 ? x4 ? x3 ? x ? 1. It involves form-
ing an inverse multiplicative matrix, exploring afﬁne
matrices, and using an 8-bit constant in the afﬁne
transformation. This process produces candidate
S-boxes. The candidate S-boxes are subsequently
evaluated to ensure they meet the criteria of balance
and bijectivity. Once these criteria are satisﬁed, the
candidate S-boxes are formalized into valid S-boxes.
The resulting S-boxes are evaluated against several
strength criteria, including nonlinearity, strict ava-
lanche criterion, bit independence-nonlinearity
criterion, bit independence-strict avalanche criterion,
linear approximation probability, and differential
approximation probability. The results indicate that
the proposed S-box
44 has a nonlinearity value of 112,
strict avalanche criterion of 0.50073, bit indepen-
dence-nonlinearity criterion of 112, bit independence-
strict avalanche criterion of 0.50237, linear approxi-
mation probability of 0.0625, and differential approx-
imation probability of 0.015625. These results
outperform the strength of the AES S-box and surpass
previous studies.

1 Introduction
The rapid development of the internet and technology
and the increasing number of internet users worldwide
impact on the increase in cybercrime. Cybercrime can
occur in various forms, including theft, piracy, and
data misuse. Therefore, data security is essential for
internet users. For this reason, it is necessary to
implement a good algorithm to protect sensitive
information.
One such algorithm is the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) [ 1]. AES has been used since 2001 to
replace the DES (Data Encryption Standard)

algorithm, which is vulnerable to linear attacks. AES
is regarded as secure today. The primary strength of
AES lies in the substitution box or S-box. The S-box
plays a role in transforming input bits into output bits
randomly during the encryption process. Encryption
functions transform original data into coded data or
encrypted data. Encrypted data must remain intact and
secure.
AES is a block cipher that encrypts data in ﬁxed-
sized blocks using substitution techniques. The sub-
stitution technique will work well and safely if the
built S-box construction produces a strong S-box.
Currently, the S-box used in AES has proven to be
very resilient to various attacks, especially linear and
differential attacks.
The construction of the AES S-box [ 1] begins by
selecting the irreducible polynomial x
8 ? x4 ? x3-
? x ? 1. This irreducible polynomial is used to
generate the multiplicative inverse matrix, followed
by applying an afﬁne transformation. The afﬁne
transformation involves multiplying the afﬁne matrix
by the multiplicative inverse matrix, subsequently
adding the result to an 8-bit constant.
In addition to the AES S-box, several other S-box
construction methods have been explored, including
various approaches. In his research, Artug ˘er [ 2]
developed an S-box construction based on the Jose-
phus problem. The algorithm applied is to iteratively
update the S-box structure to maximize nonlinearity
and eliminate ﬁxed points, thereby producing a highly
secure S-box for block cipher applications. Razaq
et al. [ 3] introduced an innovative S-box construction
method that utilizes a new algebraic subgroup, S*16,
from the symmetric group S16 with an order of 1536.
This method generates 2,359,296 S-boxes. Five
S-boxes were selected as samples with a nonlinearity
value of 112 and varying Strict Avalanche Criterion
values, namely 0.4985, 0.5034, 0.5014, 0.5021, and
0.5024. Ma et al. [ 4] presented a method to generate
dynamic S-boxes using a modiﬁed Two-Dimensional
Hyperchaotic Effect Coupled Map Lattice (2D-
HECML) system. This system combines a novel
M-sequence and a spherical cavity hyperchaotic
mapping. This system is also utilized to enhance its
chaotic behavior and cryptographic properties. The
resulting S-box is highly secure against various
attacks. Ning et al. [ 5] introduced a method that
generates dynamic S-boxes. This method uses a hybrid
spatiotemporal chaotic system. The superior chaotic
characteristics of the system make it highly suitable for
cryptographic applications. The resulting S-box
demonstrates robust security against various attacks.
Zhao et al. [ 6] proposed a new scheme for constructing
efﬁcient S-boxes. The methods employed include
chaotic maps and new permutation sequences. The
analysis results show that the resulting S-box exhibits
high nonlinearity and low differential uniformity and
satisﬁes the SAC and BIC criteria, thereby enhancing
the algorithm’s ability to resist differential and linear
cryptographic attacks.
In another study, Ali et al. [ 7] proposed a method
that combines Frobenius automorphism and Mo ¨ bius
transformation over GF (2
8). This method generates
S-boxes with high nonlinearity values. The use of non-
degenerate 3D hyperchaotic maps in S-box design was
also investigated by Lin and Liu [ 8]. Similarly, a
strong S-box construction method was proposed based
on non-degenerate enhanced 3D quadratic maps (3D-
IQM) [ 9]. This S-box satisﬁes cryptographic criteria
and eliminates ﬁxed points and short cycles. The
introduction of a new 2D discrete hyperchaotic map
for creating high-performance S-boxes is also high-
lighted [ 10]. This map generates eight dynamic
S-boxes that improve encryption strength and resis-
tance to security attacks.
Another approach combines 2D hyperchaotic maps
with algebraic operations [ 11]. This approach is used
to construct dynamic S-boxes. The results of this
approach are improved encryption strength and
increased resistance to various attacks. Pseudo-ran-
dom S-boxes [ 12] were proposed with a focus on
improving the Vigene `re cipher. The generated
S-boxes are derived from chaotic maps. These S-boxes
improve encryption strength by enhancing the ava-
lanche effect and resisting differential attacks. In
addition, [ 13] proposes an S-box construction method
using a two-dimensional discrete hyperchaotic map
with enhanced chaotic properties. This method gen-
erates twelve S-boxes. These S-boxes are applied to
the grouped data elements using bitwise and modular
XOR operations, followed by chaotic randomization
to generate the ﬁnal cipher. A robust S-box design is
proposed using the true physical randomness of phase
noise combined with the SHA-256 hash algorithm
[14]. This method signiﬁcantly improves the strength
of the S-boxes by improving their performance in
nonlinearity, SAC, and BIC tests. The use of twisted
Boolean functions [ 15] for the new S-box design is
123
3870 Alamsyah et al.
also introduced. These functions are maximally non-
linear but inherently imbalanced, requiring imbalance
mitigation to ensure bijectivity.
Another method introduced with a novel approach
combines of chaos and nonlinear confusion compo-
nents. In this method, S-boxes are developed by
constructing them using double afﬁne transforma-
tions, resulting in 40,320 S-boxes. Subsequently,
utilizing the nonlinear Lorenz dynamic system, com-
bined with the Chirikov discrete iterative map, the
three best S-boxes with a nonlinearity value of 112 are
selected [ 16]. This technique incorporates a dynamic
optimization phase that increases the nonlinearity of
the initial S-box conﬁguration. The result is the
generation of multiple robust S-boxes by slightly
varying the input parameters. A different strategy was
employed by [ 17] using Griewank function and sin
mapping. Other researchers [ 18–21] have generated
robust S-boxes. S-box construction was achieved
using afﬁne and quadratic polynomial transformation
methods and a unique permutation approach [ 18], a
new chaotic map [ 19], a hyperchaotic system two-
dimension Chebyshev–Sine coupling map (2D-
CSCM) [ 20], modiﬁed Piece Wise Linear Chaotic
Maps [ 21]. The effectiveness of these approaches has
been validated through simulations, demonstrating
resistance to various attacks.
In other studies, various innovative approaches
have been proposed to improve the design and
implementation of S-boxes. One notable method uses
particle swarm optimization (PSO) [ 22–24] combined
with Rossler map [ 22], chaotic maps [ 23], and highly
nonlinear [ 24]. The generated S-boxes have been
effectively utilized in various applications. The
Dynamic and Secure S-box (DS2B) [ 25], designed
for IoT platforms, is a research result that has been
proposed. This S-box has a high nonlinearity value and
a low differential uniformity value. Additionally, this
S-box was implemented on an FPGA showed high
throughput and was proven highly to secure speech
encryption during silent periods. A combination of
cuckoo search algorithms paired with discrete space
chaos map [ 26]. A chaos map-based block cipher
scheme [ 27], chaotic map [ 28, 29], Latin square [ 30],
quantum S-box [ 31], Linear Recurrences [ 32], 4D
hyperchaotic system [ 33], and a novel chaotic-based
S-box [ 34] have also produced S-box with high
nonlinearity values. Furthermore, new S-box designs
utilizing array indexing and chaotic S-boxes [ 35], a
chaotic map based on the multiplication of integer
numbers [36], elliptic curves and coupled map lattices
[37], the Mobius Group and Finite Fields [ 38], and S-P
boxes [
39] were introduced. This approach success-
fully improved security with a high nonlinearity value.
The use of chaotic permutation [ 40] was implemented
to generate an optimal S-box. Further research intro-
duced a 3D chaos map-based encryption algorithm for
multiple images, with a critical module dedicated to
S-box generation [ 41]. This approach, when combined
with AES, signiﬁcantly improved the encryption
strength. Another study introduced a new S-box
design that uses chaos maps and an improved artiﬁcial
bee colony algorithm [ 42]. This method enhances
cryptographic properties such as nonlinearity and
SAC, outperforming recent S-box designs and offering
a practical approach for creating strong S-boxes.
However, vulnerabilities in chaos-based S-box
encryption have been identiﬁed.
One study highlighted that the system can be
compromised through chosen-plaintext and chosen-
ciphertext attacks, enabling key retrieval with minimal
effort [ 43]. This highlights the need for stronger
cryptographic methods. In this paper, the recovery of a
substitution box from a chosen-plaintext attack is
presented. A secure image encryption algorithm
combines chaos maps with 16 newly designed S-boxes
derived from the projective general linear group and
Galois ﬁeld polynomials [ 44]. This S-box, integrated
with the Lorenz chaos system, signiﬁcantly improves
the encryption strength, with its effectiveness con-
ﬁrmed through rigorous cryptographic analysis. In
addition, a paper presents a three-layer optimization
method for generating high-performance S-boxes
using a new chaos map and artiﬁcial jellyﬁsh
optimization [ 45], pseudo-random coupling [ 46].
Furthermore, in [ 47], an S-box construction based on
the Henon map has been designed. The result is key-
dependent bijective S-boxes and pseudo-random
sequences. These generated S-boxes are implemented
in a color image encryption scheme that is resistant to
various types of attacks, particularly differential
attacks. A dynamic S-box has been constructed based
on a piecewise map to achieve low automatic corre-
lation [48]. The performance of the S-box is measured
using nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, linear
approximation probability, and differential approxi-
mation probability, with results close to the ideal
criteria. Additionally, the generated S-box is
123
AES S-box modiﬁcation uses afﬁne matrices exploration 3871
implemented in image encryption to withstand various
attacks. Lastly, in [ 49], an S-box was introduced that
was constructed using a key-dependent algorithm,
which generates a set of Boolean functions f1, f2, …,
fn, such that the resulting S-box is bijective and
nonlinear.
Overall, the AES S-box and the S-boxes produced
from previous studies are robust against various
attacks, especially linear attacks and differential
attacks [ 2–49]. However, it is still possible that the
strength of the resulting S-box can be improved to be
better than that of previous studies.
The research aims to enhance the strength of the
S-box by modifying the AES S-box. The approach
used involves the irreducible polynomial x
8 ? x4-
? x3 ? x ? 1, exploration of afﬁne matrices, and
8-bit constants. The method presented in this paper
builds upon the development of previous research
[50]. The afﬁne transformation process uses the best
afﬁne matrix selected from 128 candidate matrices.
The resulting S-box is evaluated using established
cryptographic strength testing standards, including
nonlinearity (NL), strict avalanche criterion (SAC),
bit-nonlinearity independence criterion (BIC-NL), bit-
strict avalanche criterion independence criterion
(BIC-SAC), linear approximation probability (LAP),
and differential approximation probability (DAP).
The best S-box produced from previous studies has
been implemented in the image encryption process
[47, 48]. Some have even developed it to the level of a
visual meaningful encryption and hiding algorithm for
multiple images [ 51], as well as an image encryption
algorithm designed for DNA storage that leverages the
information processing mechanisms of molecular
biology [ 52]. However, this study focuses on improv-
ing the S-box construction to produce encrypted data
that is robust against various types of attacks, partic-
ularly linear and differential attacks.
The main contributions of the paper are detailed as
follows:
(1) Modiﬁcation of AES S-box Algorithm:
The paper introduces a modiﬁed S-box for the AES
encryption algorithm. The modiﬁcation begins with
the irreducible polynomial in the AES S-box (specif-
ically x
8?x4?x3?x?1). Although it uses the same
irreducible polynomials as AES, it produces an S-box
that is stronger than the AES S-box.
(2) Exploration of Afﬁne Matrices:
The study explores a vast number
(18,446,744,073,709,551,616) of possible afﬁne
matrices. After rigorous testing for balance and
bijectiveness, only 128 afﬁne matrices meet the
necessary criteria for constructing an S-box.
(3) Formation of a New S-box (S-box
44):
Using the selected 128 afﬁne matrices, the irre-
ducible polynomial, and an 8-bit constant in the afﬁne
transformation, the study constructs a new S-box
called S-box
44.
(4) Evaluation of Cryptographic Strength:
S-box44 is thoroughly tested against several cryp-
tographic strength metrics:
(a) Nonlinearity (NL): Achieved a value of 112.
(b) Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC): Achieved a
value of 0.50073.
(c) Bit Independence Criterion—Nonlinearity
(BIC-NL): Achieved a value of 112.
(d) Bit Independence Criterion—Strict Avalanche
Criterion (BIC-SAC): Achieved a value of
0.50237.
(e) Linear Approximation Probability (LAP):
Achieved a value of 0.0625.
(f) Differential Approximation Probability (DAP):
Achieved a value of 0.015625.
(5) Comparison with AES S-box:
The results demonstrate that S-box
44 is stronger
than the original AES S-box, with the following
improvements:
(a) SAC Improvement: 0.828790%
(b) BIC-SAC Improvement: 0.44390%
(c) Overall S-box Performance Improvement:
0.00268%
(6) Comparison with S-boxes from Previous
Studies:
The proposed S-box, S-box
44, is also compared
with the S-boxes from previous studies. S-box 44
outperforms those S-boxes with a strength value
(SV) of 16.0031, indicating its superior cryptographic
strength.
These contributions collectively demonstrate the
enhanced security provided by the proposed S-box
44,
making it a promising candidate for improving the
robustness of encryption algorithms against various
cryptographic attacks.

2 AES S-box
The AES S-box construction uses the irreducible
polynomial x
8 ? x4 ? x3 ? x ? 1. A multiplicative
inverse matrix is formed using this polynomial, as
shown in Table 1. This table is then used to construct
the S-box by applying an afﬁne transformation. The
afﬁne transformation involves the use of an afﬁne
matrix and an 8-bit constant. The afﬁne matrix and 8-
bit constant are represented by matrices K
AES and

AES S-box modiﬁcation uses afﬁne matrices exploration 3873
3.1 Afﬁne matrix exploration
An afﬁne matrix is an 8 9 8 matrix where each
element in GF (2) is either 0 or 1. Exploring afﬁne
matrices begins by determining the number of rows
and columns in the matrix. The afﬁne matrix has eight
rows and eight columns, resulting in a total of 64
elements in the matrix. Each element can be either 0 or
1. Exploration of afﬁne matrices begins with a matrix.

3.2 Candidate S-box construction
The key components for constructing an S-box
candidate are the same as those used for constructing
an S-box. This research utilizes one irreducible
polynomial, 2
64 afﬁne matrices, and one 8-bit con-
stant. Therefore, there are 1 9 264 9 1 candidate
S-box constructions, resulting in
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 candidate S-boxes.
These candidates include combinations of one irre-
ducible polynomial, 2
64 afﬁne matrices, and one 8-bit
constant.
Not all candidate S-boxes constructed with one
irreducible polynomial, 2 64 afﬁne matrices, and one
8-bit constant qualify as valid S-boxes. For an S-box
construction to be considered valid, it must satisfy two
key conditions: balance and bijectivity. The selection
of the afﬁne matrix determines whether the resulting
S-box satisﬁes the balance and bijectivity criteria.
Fulﬁlling these criteria is crucial for producing a valid
S-box. A detailed explanation of the balance and
bijectivity criteria is provided in the following section.

3.3 S-box candidate testing
3.3.1 Balance
The balance criterion is satisﬁed if the number of
output bits equal to 0 is the same as the number of
output bits equal to 1. Mathematically, an S-box
satisﬁes the balance criterion if it meets the condition
in Eq. ( 1).
# xjfxðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ # xjfxðÞ ¼ 1fg ð1Þ
According to Eq. ( 1), the balance criterion is
satisﬁed if the number of inputs x for which f(x)=0
is equal to the number of inputs x for which f(x)=1 .
For GF (2
8), the value of each side in Eq. ( 1) is 128.
3.3.2 Bijective
The bijective criterion ensures that the input bits are
randomized to become output bits and can be reverted
to their original input state after decryption. In GF
(28), a candidate S-box satisﬁes the bijective criterion
if each output value in the range [0, 255] is unique.
3.3.3 The S-box candidate becomes the S-box
For example, Table 2 presents a candidate S-box. It
will be demonstrated that this candidate S-box can
become a valid S-box after passing both the balance
test and the bijective test.
3.3.3.1 Balance test The results of the balance test
are presented in Table 3. According to Table 3, the
calculation results from Eq. ( 1) are as follows:
# xjf 0ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 0ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 1ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 1ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 2ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 2ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 3ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 3ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 4ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 4ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 5ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 5ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 6ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 6ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128
# xjf 7ðÞ ¼ 0fg ¼ 128 # xjf 7ðÞ ¼ 1fg ¼ 128.
Thus, the balance criterion for the S-box candidate
in Table 2 is satisﬁed.
3.3.3.2 Bijective test According to Table 2, the
output values of the S-box candidate are all unique
and fall within the range [0, 255]. Thus, the bijective
criterion is satisﬁed for the S-box candidate in Table 2.
Based on the explanations in Sects. 3.3.3.1 and
3.3.3.2, the S-box candidate in Table 2 satisﬁes both
the balance and bijective criteria. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the candidate in Table 2 is a valid
S-box.
3.4 Final AES S-box modiﬁcation
The test results for the S-box candidate, as described in
Sects. 3.3.3.1 and 3.3.3.2, indicate that the S-box
candidate listed in Table 3 satisﬁes both the balance
and bijective criteria. Therefore, this candidate S-box
is designated as the AES S-box.
Out of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 S-box candi-
dates tested, 128 valid S-boxes were identiﬁed. These
128 S-boxes are constructed by combining one
irreducible polynomial x
8 ? x4 ? x3 ? x ? 1, 128
afﬁne matrices, and one 8-bit constant, CAES. The 128
selected afﬁne matrices used to construct the S-box are
represented by matrices K1, K2, K3, …, and K128.
In this section, ﬁve S-boxes will be constructed
using ﬁve different afﬁne matrices. These matrices are
selected based on four randomly chosen afﬁne matri-
ces and one speciﬁcally selected afﬁne matrix. The
ﬁve afﬁne matrices used are K
4, K44, K81, K111, and
K128.

The construction of these S-boxes involves modi-
fying the AES S-box by using the irreducible polyno-
mial x
8 ? x4 ? x3 ? x ? 1, afﬁne matrices K4, K44,
K81, K111, and K128, and an 8-bit constant CAES.
This modiﬁcation results in S-boxes: S-box 4,S -
box44, S-box81, S-box111, and S-box 128. These S-boxes
are presented in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

A detailed explanation of the S-box
44 construction
process, along with example calculations, is provided
in the following section.
The S-box 44 construction process consists of sev-
eral steps, namely:
Step 1 Determine the irreducible polynomial. The
irreducible polynomial used in the S-box 44 construc-
tion is x8 ? x4 ? x3 ? x ? 1.
Step 2 Determine the multiplicative inverse matrix.
The multiplicative inverse matrix is obtained by
calculating the inverse of all values in GF (2
8)
modulated by the irreducible polynomial x8 ? x4-
? x3 ? x ? 1. The complete results of the multi-
plicative inverse matrix are shown in Table 1.
Step 3 Perform the afﬁne transformation process.
The afﬁne transformation is described in Eq. ( 2).
BXðÞ ¼ K44:X/C0 1 þ CAES
/C0/C1
mod2 ð2Þ
where:
B(x)i sa1 9 8 matrix representing the S-box
values as an 8-bit output.
K44 is an 8 9 8 matrix representing the optimal
afﬁne matrix.
X-1 is a 1 9 8 matrix representing the values of the
multiplicative inverse.
CAES is a 1 9 8 matrix representing the 8-bit
constant values.
As an illustration, if the input S-box is in row 0 and
column 15, as shown in Fig. 1, the 8-bit representation
of the input S-box is X = 00001111. The value of X-1
is obtained from the multiplicative inverse matrix
(Table 1) by taking the element from row 0 and
column 15, yielding the value 199 (decimal) or
11000111 (binary). Subsequently, the afﬁne transfor-
mation calculation is performed, as shown in Eq. ( 3).

According to Eq. ( 3), the value of
B(X) = 11010110 (binary) or 214 (decimal) is
obtained as shown in Fig. 2.
Similarly, if the input S-box is located at row 15 and
column 15, as shown in Fig. 3, the 8-bit representation
of the input S-box is X = 11111111. The value of X

is obtained from the multiplication inverse matrix
(Table 1) by taking the element from row 15 and
column 15, yielding the value 28 (decimal) or
00011100 (binary). Subsequently, the afﬁne transfor-
mation calculation is performed, as shown in Eq. ( 4).

The complete results of the S-box
44 construction
are shown in Table 5.
4 S-box strength testing
This section evaluates S-box 4, S-box 44, S-box 81,
S-box111, and S-box 128 using standard S-box testing
criteria, including NL, SAC, BIC-NL, BIC-SAC,
LAP, and DAP. The following section presents a
detailed explanation and the results of these tests.
4.1 Nonlinearity (NL)
NL testing utilizes the mathematical formulation
presented in Eq. ( 5).
NLðf ðxÞÞ ¼ min dðf ðxÞ; gðxÞÞ ð 5Þ
where d(f(x), g(x)) represents the Hamming distance
between the function f(x) and all n-variable afﬁne
functions, and x is a variable taking values ranging
from 0 to 7. The NL test results for S-box
4, S-box 44,
S-box81, S-box 111, and S-box 128 are listed in Table 9.

Table 9 shows that the NL value for each proposed
S-box is 112.
4.2 Strict avalanche criterion (SAC)
SAC testing utilizes the mathematical formulation
presented in Eq. ( 6), with the ideal SAC value being
0.5.
Sx ; iðÞ ¼

where cn
i is an n-dimensional vector with a Hamming
weight of 1 at the ith position. The SAC test results for
S-box4, S-box 44, S-box 81, S-box 111, and S-box 128 are
listed in Table 10.
According to Table 10, the best SAC value is
0.50073, with S-box 44 achieving a difference of
0.00073 from the ideal value.
4.3 Bit independence criterion nonlinearity (BIC-
NL)
The BIC-NL value is calculated using the same
mathematical formulation as NL, presented in
Eq. ( 5). However, the difference lies in the output
bit in the BIC-NL test. The BIC-NL test results for
S-box4, S-box 44, S-box 81, S-box 111, and S-box 128 are
listed in Table 11.
Table 11 shows that the BIC-NL value for each
proposed S-box is 112.
4.4 Bit independence criterion strict avalanche
criterion (BIC-SAC)
The BIC-SAC value is calculated using the same
mathematical formulation as SAC, presented in
Eq. ( 6). However, the difference in the BIC-SAC test
lies in the output bit. The BIC-SAC test results for
S-box
4, S-box 44, S-box 81, S-box 111, and S-box 128 are
listed in Table 12.
According to Table 12, the best BIC-SAC value is
0.50098, with a difference of 0.00098 from the ideal
value achieved by S-box 81 and S-box 111.
4.5 Linear approximation probability (LAP)
LAP testing uses the mathematical formulation pre-
sented in Eq. ( 7).
LAP ¼ max

where X is a set of all possible inputs, Cx represents all
possible masking of input x, and Cy represents all
possible masking of the output S(x).
The LAP test results for S-box
4, S-box 44, S-box 81,
S-box111, and S-box 128 are listed in Table 13.

Table 13 shows that the LAP value for each
proposed S-box is 0.0625.
4.6 Differential approximation probability (DAP)
DAP testing uses the mathematical formulation pre-
sented in Eq. ( 8).
DAP ¼ max

where X is the set of all possible inputs, the DAP test
results for S-box 4, S-box 44, S-box 81, S-box 111, and
S-box128 are listed in Table 14.
As presented in Table 14, the DAP value for
S-box4, S-box 44, S-box 81, S-box 111, and S-box 128 is
uniformly 0.01563. This uniformity indicates
stable performance across all proposed S-boxes in
terms of differential approximation probability, a
critical measure of cryptographic strength. The iden-
tical DAP values suggest that these S-boxes offer a
comparable level of resistance to differential crypto-
graphic attacks, underscoring their robustness.
5 Proposed selected S-box
According to Tables 9, 11, 13, and 14, the strengths of
S-box
4, S-box 44, S-box 81, S-box 111, and S-box 128 are
identical. However, Tables 10 and 12 reveal differ-
ences in the SAC and BIC-SAC values. Therefore, a
new mathematical formulation is introduced to deter-
mine the proposed S-box. The mathematical formu-
lation is presented in Eq. ( 9).
S ¼ abs SAC /C0 0:5ðÞ þ absðBICSAC /C0 0:5Þ
2 ð9Þ
S is the ﬁnal value used to determine the proposed
S-box, and the ideal S value is 0. The closer the S value
is to 0, the stronger the resulting S-box. The S values
for the proposed S-boxes are presented in Table 15.
According to Table 15, the sequence of S-boxes
with the S value closest to 0 begins with S-box 44 with a
value of 0.00155, followed by S-box 111 with a value of
0.00257, S-box 81 with a value of 0.00269, and
S-box128 with a value of 0.00591. On the other hand,
the S-box with the value farthest from 0 is S-box 4 with
a value of 0.00677. This sequence illustrates the
variation in S values, reﬂecting the proximity of each
S-box to the ideal reference value of 0. Thus, the best S
value is found in S-box 44 with a value of 0.00155.
Therefore, S-box 44 is proposed as the selected S-box.
S-box44 is detailed in Table 16. The distribution of
SAC and BIC-SAC values is further described in
Tables 17 and 18.
6 Performance analysis of the proposed S-box
This section compares the strength of the proposed
S-box
44 with the AES S-box and S-boxes from
previous studies.

The AES S-box is shown in Table 2. A detailed
comparison of the strength between the AES S-box
and S-box 44 is provided in Table 19. According to
Table 19, the AES S-box and S-box 44 exhibit the same
strength for the NL, BIC-NL, LAP, and DAP criteria,
with values of 112, 112, 0.0625, and 0.01563,

112, observed in the S-boxes designed by Razaq et al.
[3], Ali et al. [ 7], Tolba et al. [ 25], and the proposed
S-box44. The highest SAC value in Table 20 is 0.5, the
ideal value achieved by the S-box created by Khan
et al. [ 34]. Unfortunately, this S-box has suboptimal
performance in the NL, BIC-NL, and BIC-SAC
criteria, with respective values of 104.5, 102.857143,
and 0.498535, resulting in an SV value of 32.644322.

AES S-box modiﬁcation uses afﬁne matrices exploration 3887
The highest BIC-SAC value, 0.50014, was achieved
by Chemlal et al. [ 12], however, their S-box falls short
in terms of the NL, SAC, and BIC-NL criteria, with
respective values of 110.75, 0.498535, and 104. The
overall SV obtained is 25.394462.
Finally, the proposed S-box
44 demonstrates the
highest overall performance with an SV value of
16.0031, surpassing all other S-boxes listed in the
table. This underscores the superior design of the
proposed S-box
44 compared to those developed in
previous research.
This analysis shows that while other S-boxes may
excel in certain criteria, the proposed S-box 44 is
overall the best across all key criteria, making it the
most robust and optimal choice for cryptographic
applications.
7 Conclusion
This study presents the construction of a modiﬁed
S-box derived from the AES S-box. The emphasis of
the modiﬁcation lies in the exploration of afﬁne
matrices, which results in the generation of
18.446.744.073.709.551.616 possible afﬁne matrices.
Upon applying balance and bijectiveness tests, only
128 afﬁne matrices meet the criteria for constructing
an S-box. By employing the irreducible polynomial
x
8 ? x4 ? x3 ? x ? 1, these 128 afﬁne matrices and
an 8-bit constant, a new S-box is formed as a
modiﬁcation of the AES S-box.
The results indicate that S-box
44, the proposed
S-box, has values of NL, SAC, BIC-NL, BIC-SAC,
LAP, and DAP as 112, 0.50073, 112, 0.50237, 0.0625,
and 0.015625, respectively. These values demonstrate
that S-box
44 is stronger than the AES S-box. The
strength improvement of S-box 44 compared to the
AES S-box is 0.828790%, 0.44390%, and 0.00268%
based on the SAC, BIC-SAC, and overall S-box
performance criteria, respectively.
Additionally, compared to S-boxes from previous
studies, S-box
44 outperforms them with an SV value of
16.0031, highlighting its superior strength.
In future research, further improvements in S-box
design could be achieved by combining the explo-
ration of afﬁne matrices with all possible irreducible
polynomials over GF (28).
